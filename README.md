# Cause mobile application

Cause is customizable tracking of any event and calculating correlations between them.

Cause is a set of tools to track any event you need to keep control and improve your life. It may be sleep habits, eating, exercises, emotions, productivity, external events - you decide what to track. Tracking is a convenient input of event time, when it occurs. You can add events retrospectively.

All events and their occurrences are saved, so they can be analyzed in the app. Or exported to CSV, so you can use your own tools to play with your data.

**If you want to test or contribute to the app, contact me at dg@wata.fun (Daniil Galkin).**

_Track anything. Get correlations. Think of causations._
